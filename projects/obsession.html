                    <p>Obsession was the first project for the Game Development course at HNU. The game is a point-and-click adventure game with turn-based combat, where the player has to solve puzzles and fight enemies to progress.
                        <h3>My role</h3>
                        I was responsible for the combat system, including the AI, the turn-based combat and the player abilities. I also worked on the game design and the implementation of the puzzles. 
                        <h3>Combat system</h3>
                        The player can choose between shooting, reloading and moving. They can take cover behind objects, and have to manage their ammo and health. Enemies have the same actions available to them, and the player has to outsmart them to win.
                        Enemies are able to take cover. They dynamically react based on their current health and the players actions. For example, if an enemy is low on health, they will prioritize taking cover.
                        <h3>Puzzles</h3>

                            <img src="../images/obsession/puzzle.png" alt="Puzzle" />
                            <p class="imageDescription">One of the puzzles in Obsession</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Obsession features multiple puzzles that the player has to solve to progress. The puzzles are mostly logic puzzles. Combat can always be avoided by solving a puzzle, but the player can also choose to fight the enemies.
                        <br /> <br />
                        If the player struggles to solve a puzzle, they can turn to their companion for help. The companion will give hints and eventually the solution to the player.
