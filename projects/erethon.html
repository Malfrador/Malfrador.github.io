                    <p>Erethon is a Minecraft server-side modding project for a PvP MMORPG. Erethon itself has existed since 2011, with me working on the project as a developer since 2017, but the current iteration started in 2020. The project is developed by a team of 10 people, and features a large-scale world with a variety of biomes, dungeons and quests. Over the years, Erethon was enjoyed by thousands of players, and has a dedicated community. <br />
                        <br />
                        The main focus of Erethon are the player-created factions, which in turn are part of three larger alliances. Inspired by older RvR games such as Dark Age of Camelot, the game mode features large-scale wars between these alliances, where players can capture and defend territory, but combines them with the Minecraft sandbox building mechanics. 
                        <br />
                        Erethon is currently in closed alpha, with a public release planned for later this year.
                        <h3>My role</h3>
                        I have developed the following features for Erethon: <br />
                        - <b>Spellbook:</b> A fully-featured RPG system with four classes, hundreds of skills and traits and everything else you would expect from a MMORPG. Explained in more detail <a href="https://schuemann.dev/index.html#papyrus">here</a>.<br />
                        - <b>QuestsXL:</b> A quest and world event system, where players can participate in events and quests to earn rewards. <br />
                        - <b>Aether:</b> A NPC system allowing for custom NPCs with custom AI and goals, who can use skills from Spellbook. <br />
                        - <b>Factions:</b> I also worked on the Factions system, implementing a economy/population/building system, similar to how games like the Anno series work. <br />
                        <br />
                        Additionally I have been responsible for the server setup and maintenance, as well as acting as one of three project leads for a team of around 10 volunteers. I am also responsible for the game design of combat and the economy, and have written a lot of the documentation for the project.
                        <h3>QuestsXL</h3>
                        <div  class="embedded-media">
                            <img src="../images/qxl/example.png" alt="Quest def" />
                            <p class="imageDescription">An example quest, written in YAML</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>QuestsXL is the system Erethon uses for quests and events. Events are activities that occur in the world, either on a schedule or triggered in some way, that players can freely participate in. Quests are more structured, have a clear goal and can only be completed once. 
                            QuestsXL uses three different components: Objectives, Actions and Conditions. Those three components are used for both events and quests. <br/ ><br />
                            - Objectives are goals that have to be completed. Completion all goals in a stage progresses to the next stage. <br />
                            - Actions are things that happen. This can be anything from giving a player an item to spawning a boss. Actions can be attached to many things, including objectives, stages, conditions and other actions. <br />
                            - Conditions are requirements that have to be met. Conditions can also be attached to objectives, stages, actions, other conditions and events. 
                            <br /> <br />
                            The ability to put those components together in a flexible way allows for a wide variety of quests and events. Some documentation and examples (in German) are available <a href="https://erethon.de/docs/questsxl/intro">here</a>. <br />
                        </p>
                        <br /> <br />
                        <h3>Factions</h3>
                        <div  class="embedded-media">
                            <img src="../images/qxl/faction_building.png" alt="Faction building configuration" />
                            <p class="imageDescription">Configuration for a building that produces grain based on farmland blocks, and also waters farmland around it.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>On Erethon, players can form factions and claim land. Each faction also has a NPC population that needs to be managed. Here I took inspiration from games like the Anno series, with different population levels and needs.<br />
                            <br />
                            Players can construct a variety of buildings, which in turn can produce resources, provide services or generate income. Buildings are constructed block by block by the players themselves.<br />
                            This way they can express their creativity in true Minecraft fashion. The Factions system however checks for some requirements, such as size and block placements, to ensure that buildings are balanced between different factions. 
                            <br /><br />
                            Each faction belongs to one of three alliances. The alliances are in a constant state of war, with the goal of capturing and holding territory. In those territories, players can again build their own fortificiations, and lay siege to enemy ones. <br />
