                    <p>Erethon is a Minecraft server-side modding project for a PvP MMORPG. Erethon itself has existed since 2011, with me working on the project as a developer since 2017, but the current iteration started in 2020. The project is developed by a team of 10 people, and features a large-scale world with a variety of biomes, dungeons and quests. Over the years, Erethon was enjoyed by thousands of players, and has a dedicated community. <br />
                        <br />
                        The main focus of Erethon are the player-created factions, which in turn are part of three larger alliances. Inspired by older RvR games such as Dark Age of Camelot, the game mode features large-scale wars between these alliances, where players can capture and defend territory, but combines them with the well-known Minecraft sandbox building mechanics.
                        <h3>My role</h3>
                        I have developed the following features for Erethon: <br />
                        - <b>Spellbook:</b> A fully-featured RPG system with four classes, hundreds of skills and traits and everything else you would expect from a MMORPG. Explained in more detail <a href="https://schuemann.dev/index.html#papyrus">here</a>.<br />
                        - <b>QuestsXL:</b> A quest and world event system, where players can participate in events and quests to earn rewards. Quests can be scripted in a flexible YAML-based language that I developed. <br />
                        - <b>Hephaestus:</b> A library for creating and managing custom items and blocks, extending existing Minecraft item behaviours. <br />
                        - <b>Aether:</b> A NPC system allowing for custom NPCs with custom AI and goals, who can use skills from Spellbook. <br />
                        <br />
                        Additionally I have been responsible for the server setup and maintenance, as well as acting as one of three project leads for a team of around 10 volunteers.
                        <h3>QuestsXL</h3>
                        <p>QuestsXL is the system Erethon uses for quests and events. Events are activities that occur in the world, either on a schedule or triggered in some way, that players can freely participate in. Quests are more structured, have a clear goal and can only be completed once. 
                            Some documentation and examples (in German) are available <a href="https://erethon.de/docs/questsxl/intro">here</a>. <br />
                            <div  class="embedded-media">
                                <img src="../images/qxl/example.png" alt="Quest def" />
                                <p class="imageDescription">An example quest, written in YAML</p>
                            </div>
                            QuestsXL uses three different components: Objectives, Actions and Conditions. Those three components are used for both events and quests. <br/ ><br />
                            - Objectives are goals that have to be completed. Completion all goals in a stage progresses to the next stage. <br />
                            - Actions are things that happen. This can be anything from giving a player an item to spawning a boss. Actions can be attached to many things, including objectives, stages, conditions and other actions. <br />
                            - Conditions are requirements that have to be met. Conditions can also be attached to objectives, stages, actions, other conditions and events. 
                            <br /> <br />
                            The ability to put those components together in a flexible way allows for a wide variety of quests and events. For example, it is incredibly easy to add optional objectives to a quest, or to have a quest that can be completed in multiple ways. In a similar vein, its super easy to scale the difficulty - just create another action that spawns more enemies, and put it in a condition that e.g. only triggers if the player is above a certain level. <br />
                            This flexibility was very important to us, and the main reason I decided to write our own quest system instead of using an existing one, as those tend to be more rigid in their structure. <br />
